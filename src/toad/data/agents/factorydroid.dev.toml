# Factory Droid

Factory Droid is an automated coding and refactoring assistant. This entry
integrates the Factory Droid CLI as an ACP agent in Toad.

## Usage

- Install and configure the Factory Droid CLI according to its documentation.
- Launch Factory Droid inside Toad via the store or from the CLI:

  ```bash
  toad -a droid
  ```

- For advanced orchestrator patterns, you can start Factory Droid as a delegated
  worker in a dedicated orchestrator terminal via
  `toad/create_orchestrator_terminal` with `command="factory-droid"` and suitable
  arguments.

Ensure `factory-droid` (or your configured CLI name) is installed and on your
PATH before launching this agent.
