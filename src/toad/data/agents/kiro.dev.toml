# Kiro CLI

Kiro is an AI code understanding and refactoring tool. This entry integrates the
Kiro CLI as an ACP agent in Toad.

## Usage

- Configure your Kiro CLI credentials and settings as usual (for example via
  `kiro-cli login` or environment variables).
- Launch Kiro inside Toad via the store or from the CLI:

  ```bash
  toad -a kiro
  ```

- For advanced setups, you can run Kiro as a delegated worker in a dedicated
  orchestrator terminal using the `toad/create_orchestrator_terminal` tool
  with `command="kiro-cli"` and appropriate arguments.

Make sure `kiro-cli` is installed and on your PATH before launching this agent.
